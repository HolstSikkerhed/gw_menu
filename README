Tiny replacement for system shells on secure gateway machines.

Allows untrusted users to run a few commands without being able to 
specify arguments, and it allows users to connect to hostnames
specified in the menu.hosts file.

	1. Install 'menu' to where your other shells are.
	2. Add the full path to the system /etc/shells file
	3. In 'menu' edit the paths of HELP, HOSTS and GREETING.
	4. Copy the HELP, HOSTS and GREETING files to the correct path.
	5. Tweak HELP, HOSTS and GREETING to fit your environment.
	6. Add users with their shell set to 'menu'

Simply add the short hostname to HOSTS, and use the system-wide ssh_config
to specify full hostnames, if needed. An example usage session follows:



$ ssh gateway.example.com
Unauthorised access prohibited.

  Contact: http://security.example.com/ -- security@example.com
Helpfiles: http://security.example.com/help/gateways/

Enter command or host name, or 'help' for help.  

gateway> help 
Type a legal command or hostname at the prompt.

Available commands:

        help            -- this menu
        uptime          -- display system uptime and load averages
        who, w, finger  -- display information about connected users
        exit            -- disconnect from the system (aliases: bye,
                           logout, quit)

Available hostnames:

	webserver buildhost fileserver 

gateway> uptime
 2:47PM  up  2:24, 4 users, load averages: 0.09, 0.09, 0.08
gateway> webserver
